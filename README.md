# Spring core: Configuration with Both XML File and annotations

## Description
Experiment with concepts of inversion of control and dependency injection by the combination of the XML file and annotations. In this project, we can see how:
* Classes will be marked as beans
* Activate component scan
* Inject constants or objects into specific variables  
* Retrieve data from the properties file
